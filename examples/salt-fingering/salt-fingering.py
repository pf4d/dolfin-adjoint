# Generalised stability analysis of double-diffusive salt fingering
# =================================================================

# .. sectionauthor:: Patrick E. Farrell <patrick.farrell@maths.ox.ac.uk>
#
# This demo solves example 4.2 of :cite:`farrell2012c`.
#
# Background
# **********
# 
# In the ocean, the diffusivity coefficient of temperature is approximately two
# orders of magnitude larger than the diffusivity coefficient of salinity.
# Suppose warm salty water lies above colder, less salty water. If a parcel of
# warm salty water sinks downwards into the colder region, the heat of the
# parcel will diffuse away much faster than its salt, thus making the parcel
# denser, and causing it to sink further. Similarly, if a parcel of cold, less
# salty water rises into the warmer region, it will gain heat from its
# surroundings much faster than it will gain salinity, making the parcel more
# buoyant. This phenomenon is referred to as ''salt fingering''
# :cite:`stern1960` and has been observed in many real-world oceanographic
# contexts :cite:`turner1985`.
#
# Ozgokmen and Esenkov :cite:`ozgokmen1998b` used a numerical model to
# investigate asymmetry in the growth of salt fingers caused by nonlinearities
# in the equation of state. In this work, we investigate the stability of the
# proposed configuration to small perturbations. Generalised stability theory
# is an extension of asymptotic linear stability theory to finite time horizons,
# and requires computing the singular value decomposition of the model
# *propagator*, whose action requires the solution of the tangent linear and
# adjoint models.
#
# Problem definition
# ******************
#
# The equations describing the system are the two-dimensional
# vorticity-streamfunction formulation of the time-dependent Navier--Stokes
# equations, coupled to two advection equations for temperature and salinity:
#
# .. math::
#            \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} + \nabla^{\perp} \psi \cdot \nabla \zeta &= \frac{\textrm{Ra}}{\textrm{Pr}}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{R_{\rho}^0} \frac{\partial S}{\partial x}\right) + \nabla^2 \zeta, \\
#            \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \nabla^{\perp} \psi \cdot \nabla T &= \frac{1}{\textrm{Pr}} \nabla^2 T, \\
#            \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + \nabla^{\perp} \psi \cdot \nabla S &= \frac{1}{\textrm{Sc}} \nabla^2 S, \\
#            \nabla^2 \psi &= \zeta,
#
# where :math:`\zeta` is the vorticity, :math:`\psi` is the streamfunction,
# :math:`T` is the temperature, :math:`S` is the salinity, and :math:`\textrm{Ra}`,
# :math:`\textrm{Sc}`, :math:`\textrm{Pr}` and :math:`{R_{\rho}^0}` are nondimensional parameters.
# Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the left and right boundaries. 
# The configuration consists of two well-mixed layers (i.e., of homogeneous
# temperature and salinity) separated by an interface. To activate the
# instability, :cite:`ozgokmen1998b` add a sinusoidal perturbation to the initial
# salinity field.
#
# Implementation
# **************
#
# We start our implementation by importing the :py:mod:`dolfin` and
# :py:mod:`dolfin_adjoint` modules

from dolfin import *
from dolfin_adjoint import *

# Next we create a 50 x 50 regular mesh of the rectangle :math:`[0, 1] \times
# [0, 2]`.  This mesh is quite coarse so that the demo runs in approximately ten
# minutes; for production computations, this might be run at 300 x 300 or 500 x
# 500.

mesh = RectangleMesh(0, 0, 1, 2, 50, 50)

# Computing the singular value decomposition of the propagator requires many
# actions of the propagator, the operator that maps perturbations in the input
# to perturbations in the output at some finite time later.  (The propagator is
# typically dense, and so the SVD is computed matrix-free.) Each action requires
# the solution of the tangent linear and adjoint systems. Since the same
# equations are solved over and over for each action, dolfin-adjoint can
# optionally cache the LU factorizations to greatly speed up subsequent
# propagator actions.

parameters["adjoint"]["cache_factorizations"] = True

# Here we enforce the periodic boundary conditions that map the right-hand
# boundary to the left-hand boundary. The :py:func:`inside` function indicates
# which boundary is to be mapped *to* (here the left); the :py:func:`map`
# function maps from the right-hand boundary to the left-hand boundary.

class PeriodicBoundary(SubDomain):
  def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
    return x[0] == 0.0 and on_boundary

  def map(self, x, y):
    y[0] = x[0] - 1
    y[1] = x[1]

pbc = PeriodicBoundary()

# Now we declare our function spaces. Since the vorticity-streamfunction
# formulation no longer has a divergence constraint, we can use piecewise linear
# Galerkin finite elements for every prognostic field, without concern for
# inf-sup stability conditions.

V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1, constrained_domain=pbc)

# We impose that the streamfunction is zero on the top and bottom.

# Now we configure the initial conditions of :cite:`ozgokmen1998b`.
# Since we want to investigate the stability of perturbations to
# salinity, we will configure the model so that it propagates a
# scalar field called "InitialSalinity" to a scalar field called
# "FinalSalinity". Therefore the steps involved in setting up the
# initial condition are:
#
# 1. Project the initial salinity field to the salinity function space
# 2. Project that field and the initial conditions for vorticity and
#    temperature into the mixed function space, while simultaneously
#    solving for the streamfunction.
